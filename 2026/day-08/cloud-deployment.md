## Day 08 – Cloud Server Setup: Docker, Nginx & Web Deployment
Task
Today's goal is to deploy a real web server on the cloud and learn practical server management.

Launch a cloud instance (AWS EC2 or Utho)
Connect via SSH
Install Nginx
Configure security groups for web access (port 80 by default for nginx)
Extract and save logs to a file
Verify your webpage is accessible from the internet
This is real DevOps work - exactly what you'll do in production.
